# MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification

This project demonstrates building and training a deep learning model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. It is part of the Udacity AWS AI and Machine Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree.

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), each of size 28x28 pixels. The goal is to classify each image into the correct digit class.
